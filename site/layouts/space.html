        <h3>What is Hackspace?</h3>
        <p class="big">University at Buffalo's computer science and engineering coworking hackerspace, managed by UB ACM.</p>
        <p>
          The Hackspace is a 30-person room that is dedicated as a computer science and engineering coworking hackerspace. Students are free to use this room during our opening hours for work.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I use this place?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! Hackspace, just like our club, is open for all UB students. UB students are free to use this space, as long as the following rules are followed:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Respect others who are using the space for work.</strong><br />
            Keep the room in a quiet and reasonable volume.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep the room clean and tidy.</strong><br />
            If you have garbage you'd like to throw out, there is a convenient garbage can located right outside the room.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No food is allowed.</strong><br />
            The Hackspace is not visited by the school custodians. We don't want fruit flies in the room.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Any infractions will result in a warning or ban from using the Hackspace.</p>
