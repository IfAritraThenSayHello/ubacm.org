        <h3>What is Hackspace?</h3>
        <p class="big">University at Buffalo's computer science and engineering coworking hackerspace, managed by UB ACM.
          The Hackspace is a 30-person room that is dedicated as a computer science and engineering coworking hackerspace.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I work here?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! Hackspace, just like our club, is open for all UB students to use as long as the following rules are followed:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Respect others who are using the space for work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep the room clean and tidy. If you have garbage you'd like to throw out, there is a
            convenient garbage can located right outside the room.
          </li>
          <li>
            No food is allowed. The Hackspace is not a space with custodial services. 
            We don't want to harbor fruit flies.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Any infractions will result in a warning or ban from using the Hackspace.</p>

        <h3>Want more hacking?</h3>
