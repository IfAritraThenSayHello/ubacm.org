# What is UB ACM?
##### Our mission is to empower student peers and help them find their path in computer science. 

We do so by running a variety of student-led initiatives and events, available for free to any University at Buffalo students.

## Our Events
All of our weekly meetings, events, and hackathons are optional, so pick and choose your favorites to come. We'd love for you to come to all of them though!

    <p>Our workshops are informative introductory workshops ran mostly by upperclassmen with expertise in the topics. We host workshops that cover a wide range of technologies used by professionals in industry or academia. We've covered Python, JavaScript, Docker, web development, and much more.</p>

## Our Community
<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8">
    <h3>Slack</h3>
    <p>We moved away from newsletters to Slack to encourage more communication and discussion between students outside of our events. Our Slack workspace has registered over 600 verified (current and past) University at Buffalo students.</p>
    <h3>Away Hackathons</h3>
    <p>In addition to <a href="https://ubhacking.com">UB Hacking</a> and <a href="/hack">Hack Nights</a>, our club also organizes members to attend hackathons together near our school. Attending hackathons are a a great way for students to learn new technologies and show some pride for our school.<br />
    <br />
    For the first time in the 2018 season, we placed University at Buffalo on the <a href="https://mlh.io/standings/na-2018">MLH rank standings</a>!
