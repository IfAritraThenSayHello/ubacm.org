# Community Code of Conduct
This is a collection of policies UB ACM will uphold in order to maintain the integrity of the club’s community. This is a living document and is subject to refinement and expansion in the future.

This code of conduct applies to all UB ACM-involved activities, including our Slack workspace, projects, competitions, and events UB ACM hosts, both online and offline. All UB ACM members are responsible in knowing and abiding by these rules. Any violations of these rules, University at Buffalo’s rules, and/or Association of Computing Machinery’s rules will result in immediate sanctions by the UB ACM leadership.

We are an open community of student computer scientists, engineers, and hackers. We consider anyone who attends our events or participates within our community’s communication mediums as a member of our club.

1. UB ACM is a student organization under the umbrella of the Association of Computing Machinery parent organization and University at Buffalo. In order to uphold our parent organizations’ reputation, all of our members must be professional while representing our club in public and within our communication mediums (i.e. UB ACM’s Slack workspace, Facebook page, etc).
2. We are diverse. Stay courteous to your fellow members and respect their identity, background, expression, values, age, race, religion, appearance, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, mental illnesses, etc. We are very serious about threats, abuse, and harassment of any kind. Safety and well being are our top priority.

## Consequences
These guidelines are subject to change with or without notice. Any person found in  violation of rules or are continually disruptive and/or disrespectful are subject to removal and ban from all UB ACM events and communication mediums on the discretion of UB ACM’s leadership.

As a University at Buffalo student club, anyone violating civil, criminal, or university laws must be and will be reported to the University police department.

## Support System
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, witness a member of the community breaking the rules, or have any other concerns, please contact a member part of UB ACM’s leadership (listed on [the UB ACM team page](http://ubacm.org/team)) in Slack or by email. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to UB ACM activities, but if you are being harassed by a UB ACM outside of our activities, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The UB ACM leadership reserves the right to exclude people from the UB ACM community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of UB ACM activities and behavior towards people who are not in the UB  ACM community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. The UB ACM leadership is not here to explain power differentials or other basic social justice concepts to you. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of UB ACM members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

*UB ACM’s Code of Conduct is proudly inspired by the great efforts of [Slashrocket.io](https://slashrocket.io/CodeOfConduct/) and [Geek Feminism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy) in maintaining their own communities and establishing their guidelines.*
