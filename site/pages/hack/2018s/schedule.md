<h2>Where can I hack?</h2>
<p><strong>Davis 101</strong> can be used for hacking throughout the event.</p>
<h2>Oh no! I can't stay for the whole time because of ____fest!</h2>
<p>For students who are attending Oozefest or Spring Fest, we understand that there are scheduling conflicts with the event, but we're happy to make </p>
<p><strong>Oozefest attendees:</strong> You can arrive at the event late, however we cannot guarantee that you'll receive a swagpack or any other swag items, as those are given away on a first-come first-serve basis.</p>
<p><strong>Spring Fest attendees:</strong> Spring Fest begins at 6:20pm, so will be able to submit your project when it opens, and submit before you leave.<br />
<br />
<em>The latest time you can enter Spring Fest when the headliner is on stage, which is around 9:45pm.</em> Since that is <strong>after</strong> Hack Night ends, you can alternatively enter Spring Fest later after the Hack Night ends. <a href="https://swipecard.sa.buffalo.edu/event/fest" target="_blank">Here are more information about the Spring Fest admission rules</a></p>
