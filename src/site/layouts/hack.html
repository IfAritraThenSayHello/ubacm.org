        <h3 class="section_label">What are Hack Nights?</h3>
        <p class="big">Weekend hack sessions at UB. Build awesome projects.</p>
        <p>
          Hack Nights are biweekly hack sessions in Davis Hall, University at Buffalo. Build awesome projects and connect with your fellow UB ACM peers.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="section_label">Why Hack Nights?</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional 24-36 hour hackathons are great for students to focus and build amazing projects in a sprint. In fact, <a href="http://ubhacking.com" target="_blank">UB Hacking</a> is so successful it is now ran as an independent event! We've seen great projects from hackathons, and hope to see them productionize and mature over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's where Hack Nights come in. We want to encourage students to work on long-term projects. During Hack Night, we turn Davis 101 into a coworking space for students to work on projects.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section_label">Prizes</h3>
