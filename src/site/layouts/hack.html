        <h3 class="section_label">What are Hack Nights?</h3>
        <p class="big">Weekend hack sessions at UB. Build awesome projects.</p>
        <p>
          Hack Nights are biweekly hack sessions at University at Buffalo. Build awesome projects and connect with your fellow UB ACM peers.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="section_label">Why Hack Nights?</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional weekend hackathons are great for students to focus and build amazing projects in a sprint. In fact, <a href="http://ubhacking.com" target="_blank">UB Hacking</a> is so successful it is now ran as an independent event! We've seen great projects from hackathons, and hope to see them productionize and mature over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's where Hack Nights come in. We want to encourage students to work on long-term projects. Hack Nights are hack sessions students can work together, in a similar environment as a hackathon.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section_label">Prizes</h3>

        <h3 class="section_label">Sponsors</h3>
        <p>  
          There's no way we can run Hack Nights without sponsors who see value in what we do for students.<br />
