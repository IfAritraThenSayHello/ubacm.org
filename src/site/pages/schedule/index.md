# Schedule

This is UB ACM's Fall 2018 schedule. This page will always be up-to-date with all of UB ACM's events and new events can be added at a later date, so make sure you check frequently!

Remember that all of our member events are optional, but we'd love for you to come by and join us! We collect check-ins at events, and members will be awarded points for checking in.

</div>

For your convenience, we created an updated calendar with all of the same events that you can add to your Google Calendar. We highly recommend you to add it to your calendar so you can stay on top of our events.
