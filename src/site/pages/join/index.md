## UB Attending Students

UB ACM is free for all University at Buffalo students of any major. UB ACM's online community can be found in our Slack workspace. UB ACM makes all of our announcements first in the Slack workspace. Sign up with your <strong>@buffalo.edu</strong> address. To stay updated, we recommend downloading the Slack application and turn on important notifications. It is available as an app for all major platforms.

We also have our club's event schedule available on our website and in a public Google Calendar. [You can find them here.](/schedule)
